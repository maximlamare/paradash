Privacy Policy for paraDash
Last Updated: 13.12.2025

I built the paraDash app as a Free app. This Service is provided by me at no cost and is intended for use as is.

This page is used to inform visitors regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use our Service.

1. Zero-Data Collection Policy
We operate on a "Local Only" basis.

We do not collect personal data: We do not require you to create an account.

We do not store data on external servers: All data generated or read by the app remains exclusively on your device.

We do not track your activity: We do not use user behavior tracking or analytics software.

2. Permissions and Data Usage
To function as a paragliding dashboard, this app requires specific permissions to process data locally on your device:

A. Storage / File Access
We request access to your device's storage.

Purpose: This is required to read existing GPS track logs (such as IGC or GPX files) that you wish to view or analyze within the dashboard. It is also required to save any data for backup purposes.

Data Handling: The app only reads the specific files you select. We do not scan your private photos or other unrelated files.

3. Third-Party Services
This app does not use any third-party services, analytics, or advertising frameworks.

4. Security
Because we do not collect or transmit your data to any server, the risk of data breach via our app is non-existent. Your flight data is as secure as your mobile device itself.

5. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in functionality (e.g., adding new features). We advise you to review this page periodically for any changes.
